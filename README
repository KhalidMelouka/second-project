This is the final Odinproject as requested. 
In this project I tried to apply everything I've learned from the html and css courses
Of course, I've used google, and Stackoverflow to try and add new css elements


The chosen landing page is called EasyBank, I've downloaded it from frontendmentor 
I haven't stayed true to the whole landing page because I still haven't learned few things, like how to put two images on top of each other
Otherwise it was a fun project, in which I truly felt I answered the questions on how to order html section in the web page
